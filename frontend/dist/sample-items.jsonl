{"content": "exactly as described, great condition, refurb phone...although it is unlocked the format stops it from being used with all carriers..."}

{"content": "Good"}
{"content": "this is no box.I don't know.so so."}
{"content": "Look's like a new brand iPhone and works perfectly. Just what i was looking for."}
{"content": "The phone stopped working after less than 30 days. I'm in Argentina and it's impossible to ship items from other countries in here. I guess it's a waste of time and money. Extremely dissapointed of my purchase and don't have any plans to shop again here."}
{"content": "Looks like a new phone. Works well."}
{"content": "Working good.."}
{"content": "Works real good"}
{"content": "Excellent product. No signs of usage. In 100% perfect condition. Does not come with original charger. No headphones also."}
{"content": "This is so much better than my old 4s. It upgraded seamlessly to os9 and works perfectly."}
{"content": "Sending it back. Apps can not download as this phone can only take up to ios 7, and all the new apps are now using ios 9"}
{"content": "The phone works great, I'm just not an iPhone person."}
{"content": "Lasted for around 27 days now it won't hold a charge. I loved it when it first game updated it to ios 9.1.2 and it screwed me over not even a month what it. I don't even know what to do.EDIT: Product works. It was just the power brick that came with it. It no longer works. I do have another power brick and the phone does hold a charge."}
{"content": "Works like a brand new phone. Works great."}
{"content": "Although this did not come with original accessories as stated, knock off charger and no headphones which were include in the original accessories of the iphone 4, the phone seems to work fine for my teenager, the exterior is in excellent shape. Will update when I take it to our carrier."}
{"content": "it was in great condition, and received it just as they stated"}
{"content": "I've got to be honest, i was a little leary about this product. I ordered it THEN looked at the reviews, boy were they unappealing to read. I was super nervous about what i had just ordered, but to my surprise, it was just fine. Yes, the phone is unlocked, but the box it came in said it would not work for any sprint or sprint affiliated carrier, so that was confusing. The battery is just as everybody says, discharges super fast and turns off when its around 20%. Phone looked brand new, no scratches. Powered right up and put my sim card in, service kicked right in. Overall, not bad."}
{"content": "No problem so far. So good"}
{"content": "This iPgone was perfect for what I needed. Arrived in perfect condition, unlocked as said, and is working perfectly."}

{"content": "I purchased this phone for my son on July 7 and on August 9 the phone conveniently died. It wouldn't charge at all and sits here as a tribute to my stupidity for listening to my teenage son who told me about purchasing a refurbished phone-- I know betterTHIS IS A SCAM! Do not buy this phone!"}
{"content": "Is old phone no is new I want my money is back no want phone"}
{"content": "recomiendo"}
{"content": "It works with my T-Mobile SIM card and functions properly I love it"}
{"content": "I was using an iPhone 6, but it was lost to the water. This looked like a good option until the new iPhone 7's are released. Unfortunately, the performance difference is significant between this phone and an iPhone 6. The battery is really weak and normally requires charging before the day is over. The phone is super slow - The camera is slow to open; apps are terrible. Not sure if it is the IOS 9 on a iPhone 4 or the phone is bad, but this thing is much slower than the iPhone 4 I had years ago. Overall, the phone is very frustrating to use!"}
{"content": "Fast ship and exactly as described. Thank you."}
{"content": "There is no damages and scratches to this item it is good as new I loved it......"}
{"content": "Iphone arrived in perfect condition, looks absolutely brand new. Battery life is great and it seems that the phone has never been used. We activated on Tracfone using their BYOP sim card and had no issues."}
{"content": "This product said it was for Verizon,but it wasn't even there's."}
{"content": "Phone is not charging, I bought it for my dad and sent it to India. It worked normal for 4-5 days then suddenly started giving problems, phone would hang often. One the torch would turn on and then it wouldn't turn off, turned off when the battery went out. Finally now the phone would not charge at all, tried to reset holding the power and start button and it would not do anything. Totally disappointed, have to figure out how to get my money back."}

{"content": "The iphone 4S was in pristine condition even though the description may not claim so. Also it was unlocked and I checked to see that it worked in AT&T. I sent the phone to India for use on the GSM network over there. I am very happy with the purchase. Highly recommended for the price. I paid $85 in July 2016."}

{"content": "great"}
{"content": "To my relief my phone worked fine. Ironically I could not activate on Verizon as a prepaid phone but it worked fine with Tracfone. I do not have any battery issues. This is just a backup phone anyway. It is not being used as a primary phone. I use it while I travel so I don't risk losing the more expensive version of this phone"}
{"content": "Just what I was waiting for!!! I just put my sym card and fix my settings, and i start using my cel right away!!!"}
{"content": "I don't received head phone with iPhone"}
{"content": "Unlocked. See the attacked"}
{"content": "It is not unlocked, i love my virgin mobile iphone and it took a dive the last week so i got this as a replacement because in the details it said it was both gms and cdmc compatible. It is locked into verizon and i now have to spend more money on a prepaid contract that doesnt even work for me which is a big strain on my budget. Cant afford to return and can't wait for a new phone, very dissapointed."}
{"content": "Good"}
{"content": "Received the phone on the date promised and looked like a brand new phone. It wasn't until activating service with a carrier and attempting to transfer contacts from my old iPhone to this new one that we realized the wifi could not be enabled from setting or from the main screen. I have never seen an iPhone that had the wifi setting locked. Can't use it...it's on its way back."}

{"content": "The battery life is horrible. I changed it fully before leaving home. Within few hours the battery was close to 10 %. It was hardly used for 10 mins of call. This seems to useless. Hope to return the device."}
{"content": "Excelent! Very good"}
{"content": "We receive without all the accessories and the charge doesn`t complete. You are selling a bad product."}
{"content": "It works! It doesn't hold a charge all day but it is ok for now. Not sure I would buy a refurbished again, especially from this seller due to the under charging."}
{"content": "Aside from relatively quickly dying battery, phone is very good. Please be sure to understand your \"carrier/service provider's\" cellular phone requirements before buying this."}
{"content": "It's a good quality phone had a problem updating it, but after that works fine, but someone changed the password to my account so might be something but overall okay buy"}
{"content": "Good thanks"}
{"content": "I have always been happy with Amazon...."}
{"content": "Excelente"}
{"content": "Phone is in very good condition but the battery is completely useless and thus the phone is useless. Even after following every iPhone tip on closing all apps, changing several settings the battery still only lasts a couple of hours without being used for even a single phone call (the battery is drained in about 3 hours even when the phone is not in use) As a longtime iPhone user I know very well about battery problems (I've also owned a 4S like this one before) This battery should have been replaced! For a product with a \"certified refurbished\" label it was definitely not what was expected."}
